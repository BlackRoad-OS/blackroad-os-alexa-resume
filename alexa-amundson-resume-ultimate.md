## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Rare Tri-Dimensional Leader:** Technical Architect + Enterprise Sales Closer + Financial Professional

I architect and build production AI systems (466K+ LOC, 145 autonomous agents), then successfully sell them to enterprise customers ($26.8M closed). FINRA-licensed (Series 7/63/65) with deep regulatory compliance expertise. Founder of BlackRoad OS, a cognitive AI operating system orchestrating 23 microservices across multi-cloud infrastructure.

**The Differentiator:** Most engineers can't sell. Most salespeople can't build. I do both at enterprise scale.

**Core Strength:** Translating complex AI/ML architectures into revenue-generating products while navigating regulated, high-compliance environments. I speak fluent C-suite (ROI, TCO, revenue impact) and fluent engineering (Kubernetes, Terraform, distributed systems).

**3. Compliance & Risk Management**
- Series 7/63/65 FINRA licenses → understand regulated industries intimately
- SOX compliance expertise → zero audit findings across multiple cycles
- PS-SHA∞ verification system → immutable audit trails for enterprise confidence

**4. Thought Leadership & Communication**
- Conference keynote speaker (450+ attendees, 4.8/5.0 rating)
- Award-winning innovator (Thought-Leadership Award)
- Can present to technical teams AND executive boards with equal fluency

**5. Systems Thinking + Business Impact**
- Every technical decision evaluated against commercial impact
- Cost optimization: 40% cloud spend reduction while maintaining 99.9% uptime
- Revenue enablement: CRM automation → $398K/year productivity gains → more deals closed

## CLOSING STATEMENT

I build production AI systems that generate revenue.

Most engineers focus on technical elegance. Most salespeople focus on quota. I optimize for **business impact** — the intersection of technical excellence and commercial success.

**My track record:**
- Built 466K LOC production platform achieving 99.9% uptime from day one
- Closed $26.8M in enterprise sales while pioneering automation saving $398K/year
- Earned FINRA licenses and navigated SOX compliance with zero audit findings
- Spoke to audiences of 450+ on technical and commercial topics (4.8/5.0 rating)

**What I'm looking for:**
An organization that values builders who can sell and sellers who can build. A role where technical depth meets commercial impact. A team that moves fast, measures everything, and obsesses over customer value.

**What you get:**
Someone who can architect your AI platform, present it to your board, sell it to your customers, and ensure it complies with SOX/GDPR/industry regulations. All while shipping code daily and hitting revenue targets.

Let's build something extraordinary together.
