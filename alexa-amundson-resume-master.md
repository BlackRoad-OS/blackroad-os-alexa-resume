## EXECUTIVE PROFILE

### The Three-Dimensional Leader

I am **Alexa Amundson**, and I represent a rare breed of executive:

**Technical Architect + Enterprise Closer + Compliance Expert**

In an industry where you typically get one of these, I deliver all three at scale:

- 🏗️ **Built** 466,408 lines of production code achieving 99.9% uptime
- 💰 **Closed** $26.8M in enterprise sales (92% quota in Year 1)
- ✅ **Passed** SOX audits with zero findings (automated compliance engine)

### Career Inflection Points

**May 2025 — Founded BlackRoad OS**
- Zero to production in 8 months (466K LOC)
- 23 microservices, 2,119 API endpoints, 99.9% uptime
- 145 autonomous agents (76 AI agents + 69 enterprise bots)
- $2M+ ARR potential through complete API offering

**July 2024 — Joined Securian Financial**
- Closed $26.8M in annuity sales (11 months, 92% quota)
- Built $40M+ pipeline across 24,000-advisor network
- Pioneered CRM automation saving $398K/year
- Keynote speaker to 450+ attendees (4.8/5.0 rating)

**March 2024 — Earned Thought-Leadership Award**
- Ameriprise Financial (12,000+ advisor organization)
- Workflow automation innovation (40 hrs/month savings)
- #1 ranking on training team in 90 days

**August 2023 — Earned FINRA Licenses**
- Series 7, 63, 65 (full securities licenses)
- Life & Health Insurance
- Deep regulatory compliance expertise

### The Differentiator

**Most engineers can't sell.** They build brilliant systems that gather dust.

**Most salespeople can't build.** They promise vaporware and hope engineering delivers.

**Almost nobody has both skills PLUS regulatory expertise.** They can't navigate SOX, GDPR, FINRA.

**I do all three at enterprise scale.**

I speak fluent C-suite (ROI, TCO, market positioning, cap tables, unit economics) AND fluent engineering (Kubernetes, Terraform, distributed systems, cryptographic verification). I understand what enterprise customers will buy, then I build it with technical excellence and ensure it passes every audit.

    start_date="2026-01-01",
    end_date="2026-01-31"
)

# All changes are PS-SHA∞ verified (immutable)
for entry in audit_log:
    print(f"{entry.timestamp}: {entry.action} by {entry.user}")
    print(f"Hash: {entry.hash} (verified: {entry.verified})")
```

**Day 11-12: Error Handling & Retry**

**9. Robust Error Handling**
```python
from blackroad.exceptions import (
    BlackRoadAPIError,
    RateLimitError,
    AuthenticationError
)

try:
    invoice = client.finance.invoices.create(...)
except RateLimitError as e:
    # Exponential backoff
    time.sleep(e.retry_after)
    invoice = client.finance.invoices.create(...)
except AuthenticationError:
    # Refresh API key
    client.refresh_auth()
except BlackRoadAPIError as e:
    # Log and alert
    logger.error(f"API error: {e.code} - {e.message}")
    alert_team(f"BlackRoad API issue: {e}")
```

**10. Performance Optimization**
```python
# Batch operations (reduce API calls)
invoices = client.finance.invoices.create_batch([
    {"customer_id": "cust_1", "amount": 10000},
    {"customer_id": "cust_2", "amount": 15000},
    {"customer_id": "cust_3", "amount": 20000}
])

# Caching (reduce latency)
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000, ttl=300)  # 5-minute cache
def get_customer(customer_id):
    return client.crm.customers.get(customer_id)
```

**Day 13-14: Testing & Go-Live**

**11. Integration Testing**
```python
import pytest

def test_invoice_creation():
    # Use sandbox environment
    client = BlackRoadClient(
        api_key=os.getenv("BLACKROAD_SANDBOX_KEY"),
        environment="sandbox"
    )

    invoice = client.finance.invoices.create(
        customer_id="test_cust",
        amount=10000
    )

    assert invoice.id is not None
    assert invoice.amount == 10000
    assert invoice.status == "draft"

def test_webhook_signature():
    payload = '{"type":"invoice.paid","data":{}}'
    signature = generate_signature(payload, webhook_secret)
    assert verify_signature(payload, signature, webhook_secret)
```

**12. Production Deployment**
```bash
# Environment variables
export BLACKROAD_API_KEY="prod_key_here"
export BLACKROAD_ENVIRONMENT="production"
export BLACKROAD_WEBHOOK_SECRET="webhook_secret_here"

# Deploy
git push production main

# Monitor
blackroad-cli logs --tail=100 --follow
blackroad-cli metrics --service=finance

# Health check
curl https://api.blackroad.io/health
# Response: {"status": "healthy", "latency_ms": 42}
```

---

### Monitoring & Observability

**Built-in Dashboards:**
```python
# Get API usage metrics
metrics = client.analytics.get_usage(
    start_date="2026-01-01",
    end_date="2026-01-31",
    group_by="endpoint"
)

# Metrics include:
# - Request count
# - Average latency (p50, p95, p99)
# - Error rate
# - Top endpoints
# - Cost (API calls × rate)
```

**Alerting:**
```python
# Configure alerts
client.alerts.create(
    name="High Error Rate",
    condition="error_rate > 1%",
    window="5m",
    notification_channels=["email", "slack", "pagerduty"]
)
```

**Performance Monitoring:**
```python
# Instrument your code
from blackroad.instrumentation import trace

@trace(service="your-app", operation="process_payment")
def process_payment(invoice_id):
    invoice = client.finance.invoices.get(invoice_id)
    # ... process payment
    return result

# Traces automatically sent to BlackRoad observability
# View in app.blackroad.io dashboard
```

## RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION

### Startup Risks & My Mitigation Strategies

#### Risk #1: "Can you scale from solo founder to team leader?"

**Evidence of Scaling Ability:**
- Securian: Led cross-functional CRM transformation (85 people impacted)
- Ameriprise: Trained 12 peers on automation techniques
- Thought leadership: Keynote speaker to 450+ attendees
- Documentation: Created training materials adopted company-wide

**Mitigation:**
- Hire strong #2 (experienced engineering manager)
- Delegate execution, focus on strategy & key decisions
- Build systems/processes before hiring (repeatable)
- Monthly skip-levels (stay connected to team)

**References Available:**
- Securian SVP (managed cross-functional initiative)
- Ameriprise peers (taught and mentored)

---

#### Risk #2: "Will you get bored with selling vs coding?"

**Evidence of Balance:**
- Shipped production code daily WHILE closing $26.8M sales
- Built automation to free up selling time (not avoid it)
- Enjoy both equally (intellectual variety)
- Understand business impact drives purpose

**Mitigation:**
- Split time 50/50 (strategic coding + key sales)
- Hire IC engineers for execution (I do architecture)
- Reserve Fridays for deep work (coding, writing)
- Scratch coding itch with high-leverage projects

**Philosophy:**
- Best sales comes from deep product understanding
- Best products come from customer conversations
- I need both to be effective

---

#### Risk #3: "Do you have management experience?"

**Honest Answer:** Limited direct reports experience (individual contributor track)

**However:**
- Led cross-functional initiatives (CRM transformation, 85 people)
- Mentored peers (12+ people trained on automation)
- Conference speaking (thought leadership to hundreds)
- Project management (multi-month initiatives, stakeholder management)

**Mitigation:**
- Take management training (Reforge, First Round Review)
- Hire experienced managers below me (learn from them)
- Monthly coaching with exec coach
- Start small (2-3 direct reports), scale gradually

**What I Bring:**
- Technical credibility (engineers respect me)
- Lead by example (ship code, close deals)
- Clear communication (conference speaking practice)
- Metrics-driven (measure everything)

---

#### Risk #4: "Can you handle ambiguity of early-stage startup?"

**Evidence of Thriving in Ambiguity:**
- Built BlackRoad OS from zero (no spec, no team, no blueprint)
- Figured out 89 Terraform modules (self-taught)
- Learned quantum computing (Qiskit, TorchQuantum)
- Navigated Securian politics (Fortune 500 bureaucracy)

**Personality Traits:**
- High tolerance for uncertainty
- Bias for action (ship, learn, iterate)
- Resourceful (figure it out vs wait for permission)
- Resilient (setbacks don't stop me)

**Mitigation:**
- Set clear OKRs (quarterly goals)
- Weekly retrospectives (what's working, what's not)
- Rapid experimentation (A/B test, measure, decide)
- Transparent communication (share wins and failures)

---

#### Risk #5: "Will compliance expertise become outdated?"

**Why This Won't Happen:**

**Regulation Increasing, Not Decreasing:**
- AI regulation coming (EU AI Act, US frameworks)
- Data privacy expanding (state-level privacy laws)
- Financial services strictening (crypto, fintech regulation)

**My Expertise Expands:**
- FINRA licenses: Foundational (like learning calculus)
- SOX compliance: Transferable to GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001
- Continuous learning: Stay current on regulations

**Mitigation:**
- Annual recertification (maintain FINRA licenses)
- Attend compliance conferences (RSA, InfoSec)
- Hire compliance experts (complement my knowledge)
- Build compliance community (share learnings)

---

## LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY & PRINCIPLES

### My Leadership Operating System

#### Core Principle #1: **Lead by Example, Not by Title**

**What This Means:**
- I don't ask others to do what I won't do myself
- I ship code alongside engineers (not just review)
- I take sales calls alongside AEs (not just strategize)
- I participate in on-call rotation (share the burden)

**Example:**
- At Securian, I built the CRM automation personally (didn't delegate)
- At BlackRoad OS, I wrote 466K LOC before hiring first engineer
- I'll always be technical (never "retired engineer who manages")

**Why This Works:**
- Earns respect (engineers respect builders, salespeople respect closers)
- Stays grounded (understand real problems, not ivory tower)
- Credibility (can make technical decisions from experience)

---

#### Core Principle #2: **Measure Everything, Decide with Data**

**What This Means:**
- Every initiative has success metrics (defined upfront)
- Weekly review of key metrics (dashboard, not vibes)
- A/B test when possible (experiment, measure, decide)
- Post-mortems for failures (blameless, data-driven)

**Example:**
- Salesforce transformation: Tracked 3,000 errors → 0 (quantified impact)
- BlackRoad OS: 99.9% uptime (measured, not claimed)
- Sales performance: 15% close rate (measured vs 6% team avg)

**Metrics I Care About:**
- **Engineering:** Deployment frequency, MTTR, test coverage, uptime
- **Sales:** Close rate, sales cycle length, pipeline velocity, quota attainment
- **Product:** NPS, feature adoption, time-to-value, churn
- **Business:** ARR, CAC, LTV, gross margin, burn rate

**Why This Works:**
- Removes emotion from decisions (data doesn't lie)
- Accountability (everyone knows their numbers)
- Continuous improvement (measure → learn → improve)

---

#### Core Principle #3: **Ship Fast, Learn Faster**

**What This Means:**
- Bias for action (ship MVP, iterate based on feedback)
- Fail fast (run experiments, kill what doesn't work)
- Velocity matters (deploy 15-20x/day, not quarterly)
- Perfect is the enemy of done (80% solution today > 100% solution never)

**Example:**
- BlackRoad OS: Zero to production in 8 months (didn't wait for perfection)
- Salesforce automation: Shipped in 8 weeks (not 6 months analysis paralysis)
- Sales: 18-day cycles (move fast, close fast)

**Framework:**
1. Define hypothesis ("Automating X will save Y hours")
2. Build minimal solution (1-2 weeks max)
3. Measure results (did we save Y hours?)
4. Decide: Double down or kill

**Why This Works:**
- Faster learning (10 small experiments > 1 big bet)
- Market feedback (customers tell you what works)
- Morale (shipping is motivating, endless planning is draining)

---

#### Core Principle #4: **Hire Slow, Fire Fast (But Compassionately)**

**What This Means:**
- Hiring: Take time (multiple interviews, work trial, reference checks)
- Firing: Don't drag out (if it's not working after 90 days, move on)
- Compassion: Severance, outplacement, honest feedback

**Hiring Bar:**
- **Technical:** Can they ship production code at our quality bar?
- **Collaborative:** Do they make teammates better?
- **Learning:** Do they seek feedback and improve?
- **Mission:** Do they care about our vision?

**Red Flags:**
- Blaming others (not accountable)
- Stopped learning (complacent)
- Lone wolf (doesn't collaborate)
- Negative energy (drains team)

**Firing:**
- Clear expectations (written goals, weekly check-ins)
- Feedback loop (monthly 1:1s, don't surprise)
- Performance plan (30 days to improve, specific metrics)
- If no improvement: Compassionate exit (severance, references, connections)

**Why This Works:**
- A-players attract A-players (B-players hire C-players)
- Team morale (one low performer drags down five high performers)
- Speed (bad fits slow everyone down)

---

#### Core Principle #5: **Transparent, Even When It Hurts**

**What This Means:**
- Share metrics (good and bad) with team
- Admit mistakes publicly (I screwed up, here's what I learned)
- Explain decisions (why we chose X over Y)
- Bad news fast (don't hide problems)

**Example:**
- If we miss revenue target: "We missed by 20%. Here's why. Here's the plan."
- If I make bad decision: "I chose wrong. Here's what I learned. Here's new direction."
- If fundraising is hard: "3 nos this week. Pipeline strong. Staying focused."

**What Gets Shared (Weekly All-Hands):**
- Revenue (ARR, bookings, pipeline)
- Customers (new logos, churn, NPS)
- Product (shipped features, bugs, incidents)
- Wins (closed deals, great feedback)
- Losses (lost deals, customer churn)
- Lessons (what we learned this week)

**Why This Works:**
- Trust (transparency builds trust, secrecy destroys it)
- Alignment (everyone understands the business)
- Ownership (team feels invested in outcomes)
- Learning (failures shared = organization learns)

---

#### Core Principle #6: **Customer Obsession, Not Feature Obsession**

**What This Means:**
- Start with customer problem (not cool technology)
- Talk to customers weekly (founder sales calls, CS check-ins)
- Build what customers will pay for (not what's technically interesting)
- Say no to features that don't solve customer pain

**Framework:**
1. Customer says: "I need feature X"
2. Ask: "What problem are you trying to solve?"
3. Understand root cause (often not what they asked for)
4. Build solution to root cause (might be different feature)
5. Validate with customer (did we solve your problem?)

**Example:**
- Customer: "I need AI to write my emails"
- Why: "I spend 3 hours/day on email"
- Root cause: Manual CRM entry (emails are symptom)
- Solution: CRM automation (saves email time + more)

**Why This Works:**
- Product-market fit (solve real problems)
- Retention (customers stay when you solve pains)
- Expansion (solving one pain → trust → solve more pains)

---

#### Quarterly Rituals

**Quarter Start: OKR Planning (Half-Day Offsite)**
- Objective: Where are we going? (qualitative)
- Key Results: How do we measure success? (quantitative)
- Initiatives: What will we do? (projects)
- Example OKR:
  - **Objective:** Become fastest API platform
  - **KR1:** <50ms p95 latency (currently 98ms)
  - **KR2:** 14-day average integration (currently 21 days)
  - **KR3:** 4.8/5.0 NPS (currently 4.5)

**Quarter End: OKR Review + Reflection**
- Did we hit OKRs? (70%+ is good)
- What did we learn?
- What to carry forward to next quarter?

---

### My Communication Style

**Default to Written:**
- Write memos (not slides) for big decisions
- Amazon-style 6-pagers (narrative, data, recommendation)
- Comment threads (async, thoughtful, documented)

**Meetings Only When:**
- Brainstorming (collaboration needed)
- Debate (multiple perspectives, real-time)
- Sensitive topics (1:1 feedback, difficult conversations)

**Over-Communicate:**
- Say important things 3 times, 3 ways (All-Hands, Slack, email)
- Repeat strategy monthly (everyone knows where we're going)
- Assume message was lost (repeat until understood)
