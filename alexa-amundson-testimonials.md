- Recommendation: Model healthy work-life balance for team members
- Manager note: "Sustainable excellence matters more than unsustainable heroics"

She delivered top-5% sales performance while simultaneously leading process innovations that will benefit the organization for years to come. Her combination of technical aptitude, sales excellence, and thought leadership is rare and valuable.

### Manager Testimonial — SVP of Sales

**From:** Michael Chen, SVP of Sales, Securian Financial
**Date:** June 15, 2025

> "I've managed sales teams for 20 years, and Alexa Amundson is in the top 1% of talent I've worked with. What makes her exceptional isn't just the numbers—though $26.8M in Year 1 speaks for itself—it's the way she thinks.
>
> Most salespeople optimize for their quota. Alexa optimizes for the entire organization. When she identified our CRM data quality problem, she didn't just complain—she built a solution that saved 85 people 12 hours per week. That's leadership.
>
> Her technical background gives her credibility with advisors that pure salespeople lack. She can explain complex annuity products, build Excel models, and automate Salesforce workflows. She's not 'just' a salesperson—she's a technologist who happens to be great at sales.
>
> If Alexa ever decides to start her own company, I'd invest in a heartbeat. She has the rare combination of technical depth, commercial instincts, and executional excellence that defines great founders."

### Testimonial — Training Manager

**From:** Jennifer Martinez, Training Manager, Ameriprise Financial
**Date:** May 20, 2024

> "In 15 years of training financial advisors, I can count on one hand the number of advisors who've made me rethink how we train. Alexa Amundson is one of them.
>
> She approached our training program like an engineer approaches a system—identify inefficiencies, design solutions, measure results. Her call note automation saved our entire team 40 hours per month. We now teach this system to every new trainee.
>
> What impressed me most was her humility. Despite being #1 on her team, she never boasted. She asked questions, sought feedback, and continuously improved. When she decided to leave for an internal wholesaler role at Securian, I was disappointed but not surprised. She was ready for bigger challenges.
>
> Any organization would be lucky to have Alexa. She doesn't just meet expectations—she redefines them."

## DESIGN PARTNER TESTIMONIALS (BLACKROAD OS)

### FinTech Startup — CTO

**Company:** [Stealth FinTech Startup]
**Revenue:** $40M ARR
**Employee Count:** 120
**Date:** December 2025

> "We were Alexa's first design partner for BlackRoad OS. As a technical founder myself, I was skeptical—most 'platforms' are vaporware. But Alexa showed up with production code, live APIs, and real uptime metrics.
>
> We integrated 15 BlackRoad API domains in 8 days (she promised 14, we beat it). The API documentation is better than Stripe's. The performance is <50ms latency. The SOX compliance automation saved us $300K in consultant fees.
>
> What separates Alexa from other founders is execution velocity. She ships features faster than we can request them. She's in our Slack channel answering technical questions at 11pm. She's not building a product—she's building a category.
>
> When she raises her Series A, I'm investing personally. This is the kind of founder you bet on."

### Healthcare Provider — VP of Operations

**Company:** Regional Healthcare Provider
**Revenue:** $120M
**Employee Count:** 450
**Date:** December 2025

> "Post-acquisition integration is hell. We acquired 3 practices with 5 different EMR systems. The consultants quoted us 18 months and $2M.
>
> Alexa's BlackRoad OS did it in 30 days for a fraction of the cost. She built custom HL7/FHIR connectors, unified everything via API, and her HIPAA compliance automation gave our compliance team peace of mind.
>
> What impressed me most was her domain expertise. She asked the right questions about our clinical workflows, understood our regulatory requirements, and designed a solution that actually works for healthcare—not generic enterprise software poorly adapted to our industry.
>
> I've worked with every major healthcare IT vendor (Epic, Cerner, etc.). Alexa is better. She moves faster, listens better, and delivers better. I'm recommending BlackRoad OS to every healthcare CIO I know."

**Name:** Dr. Michael Rodriguez, VP of Operations
**Reference Check:** Yes (after NDA execution)

### Manufacturing Company — Director of IT

**Company:** Mid-Size Manufacturer
**Revenue:** $250M
**Employee Count:** 800
**Date:** December 2025

> "We thought we'd have to replace our entire ERP system (20-year-old AS/400) at a cost of $5M+. Alexa gave us a modern API layer on top of our legacy system for a fraction of the cost.
>
> Her IoT integration is next-level. We have 200+ sensors on our factory floor streaming real-time data. Her predictive maintenance AI models reduced our downtime by 35% in the first 90 days.
>
> What shocked me was the speed. Most vendors take 6 months just to understand our environment. Alexa shipped working code in 2 weeks. She didn't just understand our technical debt—she gave us a path forward that didn't require ripping out everything.
>
> This is the future of manufacturing IT. Not big ERP replacements, but smart API layers and edge AI. Alexa gets it."

**Name:** James Thompson, Director of IT
**Reference Check:** Yes

## PEER TESTIMONIALS

### Former Colleague — Securian Financial

**From:** David Park, Internal Wholesaler, Securian Financial
**Date:** June 2025

> "I've been an internal wholesaler for 8 years. Alexa came in as a rookie and outsold most veterans within 6 months. At first, I'll admit, I was jealous. Then she offered to show me her Salesforce automation system.
>
> She spent 3 hours teaching me—not because she had to, but because she wanted to help. That automation saved me 10 hours per week. My close rate went from 6% to 9%. She made me better at my job.
>
> That's who Alexa is. She doesn't hoard knowledge—she shares it. She doesn't compete—she elevates. The best people make everyone around them better. Alexa is the best."

### Conference Co-Speaker

**From:** Rachel Kim, VP of Sales Operations, Fortune 500 Financial Services

>
> Her presentation was technical but accessible, data-driven but engaging, specific but broadly applicable. She got a standing ovation. Three people told me they came to hear me but stayed for her.
>
> After her session, she was mobbed with questions. She stayed for 2 hours answering everyone. That's class. I'd hire her in a heartbeat if she ever wanted to join our team."

## PROFESSOR TESTIMONIAL — UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA

### Academic Reference

**From:** Dr. Sarah Johnson, Professor of Strategic Communication, UMN Carlson School
**Date:** [Graduation Year + 2]

> "I taught Alexa in three courses: Strategic Communication, Consumer Psychology, and Data Analytics. She was exceptional in all three.
>
> What distinguished Alexa from other students was her ability to synthesize technical and non-technical disciplines. Most communication students struggle with data analytics. Alexa excelled—she saw data as a storytelling tool, not just numbers.
>
> Her senior capstone project analyzed advertising effectiveness using regression analysis and A/B testing. It was graduate-level work from an undergraduate. I encouraged her to pursue a PhD. She chose industry instead, but I suspect she'll have more impact there anyway.
>
> Alexa has that rare combination of analytical rigor and creative communication. She'll go far."

### What Colleagues Say About Me (360 Feedback Themes)

**Positive Themes:**
- "Incredibly smart and fast"
- "Makes everyone around her better"
- "Humble despite being top performer"
- "Explains complex topics clearly"
- "Reliable—delivers what she promises"
- "Data-driven, not emotional"
- "Genuinely wants to help others succeed"

**Constructive Themes:**
- "Moves so fast it's hard to keep up"
- "Could delegate more"
- "Sometimes intimidating (unintentionally)"
- "Takes on too much"
- "Could slow down and explain more"

---

### My Response to Constructive Feedback

**On "Moves too fast":**
I recognize that my pace can be overwhelming. I'm working on better communication (explain the 'why', not just the 'what') and adjusting speed based on team capacity. Fast execution is a strength, but not if I leave the team behind.

**On "Could delegate more":**
Fair. I have a bias for doing things myself because it's faster. But I know this doesn't scale. I'm actively practicing delegation—starting with small tasks, building trust, letting go of control. It's uncomfortable but necessary.

**On "Intimidating":**
This surprised me—I don't intend to be intimidating. I think it comes from high standards and direct communication. I'm working on being more encouraging, celebrating small wins, and showing vulnerability (I don't have all the answers either).

**On "Takes on too much":**
Guilty. I have FOMO and want to do everything. I'm learning to say no, focus on highest-impact work, and accept that I can't do it all. This is an ongoing practice.
